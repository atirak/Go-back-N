# Go-back-N Protocol

In this project, a Go-Back-N network protocol is implemented in C using the socket library. 

The protocol consists of the following three stages: (a)  connection setup, (b) data transmission, and (c) connection teardown.

## A general description of the protocol

### Connection Setup

First, the connection is set up with a 3-way handshake between the sender and receiver as shown in the diagram below.

It is implemented on the **sender**  in `gbn_connect()`  and  on the **receiver** in `gbn_accept()`.

### Data Transmission

Once the connection is established, the data is sent in DATA packets by the **sender** in `gbn_send()`. Each DATA packet is acknowleged by the **receiver** by sending an ACK packet in `gnb_recv()`.

The design is illustrated in the diagram below.

### Connection Teardown

One the data transmission is completed, the connection is torn down by both sender and receiver by sending FIN packets in `gbn_close()`.

The design is illustrated in the diagram below.

## The tricky parts of the implementation

The most tricky part of the implementation is figuring out the logic for the the `gbn_sender()` and `gbn_receiver()`. 
We tackled this by relying on the Finite State Machine (FSM) as below:

## Known Issues

There are timeout issues when sending and receiving ACK during data transmission using `gun_send()` and `gbn_recv()`. Despite hours spent, we were unable to resolve this issue. We tested that 3-way hand shake works successfully. Then we tested with `sendto()` function and it works as well. However, after changing with maybe_sendto() function the timeout issue occurs. We thought it possible occurs from `gnn_receive().`
